    Analysis:


    The root App component should handle the overall structure and navigation of
    the 'OK Web App'. Based on the provided task and view descriptions, the
    following key functionalities should be implemented:


    1. **Paths and Unique Views**:
       - The App component should define the following paths and their corresponding unique views:
         - `/` - `UV_Landing` view
         - `/customize-button` - `UV_CustomizeButton` view
         - `/settings` - `UV_Settings` view
         - `/share` - `UV_ShareApp` view

    2. **Global Shared Views**:
       - The App component should include the following global shared views:
         - `GV_TopNavBar` - Positioned at the top of the screen, this navigation bar should be present on all pages.
         - `GV_Footer` - Positioned at the bottom of the screen, this footer should be present on all pages.

    3. **Auth Restrictions**:
       - The provided details indicate that all views should be accessible to both authenticated and unauthenticated users. Therefore, there is no need for any auth-related restrictions in the App component.

    4. **Store Provider Wrapper**:
       - The App component should be wrapped by the `Provider` component from the global state store defined in `@/store/main.tsx`. This will provide the application with access to the necessary state management features.

        </Provider>
      );
    };
