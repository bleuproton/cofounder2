      UV_Landing:
        title: OK Web App Landing
        extendedDescription: This is the main landing page of the 'OK Web App'. It
          features a large, prominent button in the center of the screen, with
          the text 'OK' displayed on the button. When the user clicks the
          button, the text 'OK' should be displayed on the screen, with a subtle
          animation or transition effect. The layout and positioning of the
          button and 'OK' text should be responsive and adapt to the user's
          device and screen size. The landing page should load quickly and
          provide a seamless user experience, with minimal wait time for the
          'OK' text to appear. The landing page should be accessible to both
          authenticated and unauthenticated users.
        notes: This is the core view of the app, where the main 'OK' button interaction
          takes place.
        role: The UV_Landing view is responsible for providing users with the primary
          functionality of the 'OK Web App' - the ability to click a button and

          on the button in the 'OK Web App'. It should feature an input field
          where the user can enter their desired button text. After the user
          submits the custom button text, the button on the landing page
          (UV_Landing) should update to display the new text. The custom button
          text should be saved and persist across the user's different devices,
          allowing them to maintain their personalized experience. The customize
          button view should be accessible to both authenticated and
          unauthenticated users.

          preferences. It should include an option to enable or disable the
          sound effects feature, allowing users to customize the interaction
          experience. The settings view should also provide information about
          the app, such as the version number, credits, and links to the app's
          privacy policy and terms of service. The settings view should be
          accessible to both authenticated and unauthenticated users.

          Web App'. It should feature a prominent button or input field that the
          user can copy or interact with to generate a shareable link. The
          shareable link should lead directly to the 'OK Web App' landing page
          (UV_Landing), allowing users to easily share the experience with
          others. The share app view should be accessible to both authenticated
          and unauthenticated users.

          potentially some additional links or actions (e.g., share button,
