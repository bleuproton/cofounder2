  # Backend Requirements Document (BRD) for 'OK Web App'


  ## I. General, Personas, Features


  The 'OK Web App' is a simple web application that allows users to click a
  button and see the text "OK" displayed on the screen. The app has two main
  user personas:


  1. **Casual User**: This user simply wants to interact with the app and see
  the "OK" text displayed.

  2. **Curious Experimenter**: This user wants to interact with the app in
  different ways, share it with others, and access it from multiple devices.


  The key features of the 'OK Web App' are:

  1. **Button Interaction**: The core feature is a button that, when clicked,
  displays the text "OK" on the screen.

  2. **Responsive Design**: The app should be designed to be responsive and work
  well on a variety of devices.

  3. **Quick Load Time**: The app should load quickly and provide a smooth user
  experience.

  4. **Shareable Link**: The app should provide a shareable link that allows
  users to easily share the experience with others.

  5. **Cross-Device Consistency**: The app should provide a consistent user
  experience across different devices.

  6. **Customizable Button Text**: Users should be able to customize the text
  that appears on the button.

  7. **Animated Transition**: The "OK" text should appear with a subtle
  animation or transition effect.

  8. **Sound Effects**: The app should optionally include sound effects, such as
  a gentle "click" or "confirmation" sound.

  9. **Analytics and Usage Tracking**: The app should include basic analytics
  and usage tracking functionality.


  ## II. REST API


  ### II.A. Justification & Reasoning


  The 'OK Web App' features do not require a complex backend with a RESTful API.
  The core functionality of displaying the "OK" text when a button is clicked
  can be easily handled by a simple serverless backend or a static web
  application without the need for a dedicated API.


  ### II.B. API Endpoints


  There are no API endpoints required for the 'OK Web App', as the application
  can be implemented as a static web page or a serverless backend that handles
  the button click interaction and displays the "OK" text.


  ## III. Realtime Websockets


  ### III.A. Justification & Reasoning


  Similarly, the 'OK Web App' features do not necessitate the use of real-time
  WebSockets. The button click interaction and the display of the "OK" text can
  be handled synchronously without the need for real-time updates or push
  notifications.


  ### III.B. Events


  There are no real-time events required for the 'OK Web App', as the
  application can be implemented without the need for real-time data updates or
  push notifications.


  ## IV. Additional Notes


  The 'OK Web App' can be implemented as a static web page or a simple
  serverless backend that handles the button click interaction and displays the
  "OK" text. The additional features, such as customizable button text,
  animations, sound effects, and analytics, can be implemented client-side
  without the need for a complex backend infrastructure.


  The provided database schema can be used to store user-specific data, such as
  customized button text and session information, as well as analytics data.
  However, the backend for the 'OK Web App' can be minimal, focusing on serving
  the static web application or handling the button click interaction without
  the need for a dedicated RESTful API or real-time WebSockets.
