  restApi:
    justifyYourAnswer: The 'OK Web App' features do not require a complex backend
      with a RESTful API. The core functionality of displaying the "OK" text
      when a button is clicked can be easily handled by a simple serverless
      backend or a static web application without the need for a dedicated API.
    required: false
  realtimeWebsockets:
    justifyYourAnswer: Similarly, the 'OK Web App' features do not necessitate the
      use of real-time WebSockets. The button click interaction and the display
      of the "OK" text can be handled synchronously without the need for
      real-time updates or push notifications.
